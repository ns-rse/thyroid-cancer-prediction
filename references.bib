A diverse set of stakeholders{\ifmmode---\else\textemdash\fi}representing academia, industry, funding agencies, and scholarly publishers{\ifmmode---\else\textemdash\fi}have come together to design and jointly endorse a concise and measureable set of principles that we refer to as the FAIR Data Principles. The intent is that these may act as a guideline for those wishing to enhance the reusability of their data holdings. Distinct from peer initiatives that focus on the human scholar, the FAIR Principles put specific emphasis on enhancing the ability of machines to automatically find and use the data, in addition to supporting its reuse by individuals. This Comment is the first formal publication of the FAIR Principles, and includes the rationale behind them, and some exemplar implementations in the community.}}

Using these measures a system that performs worse in the objective sense of Informedness, can appear to perform better under any of these commonly used measures. We discuss several concepts and measures that reflect the probability that prediction is informed versus chance. Informedness and introduce Markedness as a dual measure for the probability that prediction is marked versus chance. Finally we demonstrate elegant connections between the concepts of Informedness, Markedness, Correlation and Significance as well as their intuitive relationships with Recall and Precision, and outline the extension from the dichotomous case to the general multi-class case.}}

Significant ORs for malignancy were demonstrated for patient age {$<$}52 years [OR: 1.82, 95{\%} CI (1.63 to 2.05), P 75{\%} compared with predominantly solid, P {$<$} 0.0001 for both], and the presence of additional nodules {$\geq$}1 cm [OR: 0.69 (0.60 to 0.79) for two nodules, OR: 0.41 (0.34 to 0.49) for three nodules, and OR: 0.19 (0.16 to 0.22) for greater than or equal to four nodules compared with one nodule, P {$<$} 0.0001 for all]. A free online calculator was constructed to provide malignancy-risk estimates based on these variables.ConclusionsPatient and nodule characteristics enable more precise thyroid nodule risk assessment. These variables are obtained during routine initial thyroid nodule evaluation and provide new insights into individualized thyroid nodule care.}}

Much effort has been invested in improving its diagnosis, and thyroidectomy remains the primary treatment method. A successful operation without unnecessary side injuries relies on an accurate preoperative diagnosis. Current human assessment of thyroid nodule malignancy is prone to errors and may not guarantee an accurate preoperative diagnosis. This study proposed a machine learning framework to predict thyroid nodule malignancy based on our collected novel clinical dataset. The ten-fold cross-validation, bootstrap analysis, and permutation predictor importance were applied to estimate and interpret the model performance under uncertainty. The comparison between model prediction and expert assessment shows the advantage of our framework over human judgment in predicting thyroid nodule malignancy. Our method is accurate, interpretable, and thus useable as additional evidence in the preoperative diagnosis of thyroid cancer.}}

	abstract = {{The detection of thyroid nodules has been increasing over time, resulting in extensive use of fine-needle aspiration (FNA) and cytology. Tailored methods are required to improve the management of thyroid nodules, including web-based tools. To assess the performance of the Thyroid Nodule App (TNAPP), a novel web-based readily modifiable, interactive algorithmic tool, in improving the management of thyroid nodules. One hundred twelve consecutive patients with 188 thyroid nodules who had FNA from January to December 2016 and thyroid surgery were retrospectively evaluated. Neck ultrasound images were collected from registry and re-examined to extract data to run TNAPP. Each nodule was evaluated for ultrasonographic risk and suitability for FNA. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and overall accuracy of TNAPP were calculated and compared to the diagnostic performance of other two algorithms (AACE/ACE/AME and ACR TI-RADS). TNAPP performed better in terms of sensitivity ({$>$}80{\%}) and negative predictive value (68{\%}) with an overall accuracy of 50.5{\%} which was similar to that found for the AACE/ACE/AME algorithm. The TNAPP displayed a slightly better performance compared to AACE/ACE/AME and ACR TI-RADS algorithms in discriminating unnecessary FNA for nodules with benign cytology (TNAPP 32{\%} vs. AACE/ACE/AME 31{\%} vs. ACR TI-RADS 29{\%}). The TNAPP reduced the number of missed diagnoses of thyroid nodules with suspicious and highly suspicious cytology (TNAPP 18{\%} vs. AACE/ACE/AME 26{\%} vs. ACR TI-RADS 20.5{\%}). Fourteen nodules that would not have been aspirated were malignant, 13 of which were microcarcinomas. The TNAPP algorithm is a reliable, easy to learn tool, that can be readily employed to improve the selection of thyroid nodules requiring cytological characterization. The rate of malignant nodules missed because of inaccurate characterization by TNAPP was low compared to the other two algorithms and almost all the cases were microcarcinomas. TNAPP{'}s use of size {$>$}20 mm as an independent determinant for considering or recommending FNA reduced its specificity. TNAPP performs well compared to AACE/ACE/AME and ACR-TIRADS. Additional retrospective and prospective studies are needed to confirm and guide the development of future iterations that incorporate different risk stratification systems and targets for diagnosing malignancy while reducing unnecessary FNA.}}

Prediction of the risk of malignancy within such a thyroid nodule is based on clinical, biochemical, ultrasonographic, and cytologic features. Our aim was to create a nomogram to predict accurately the chance of malignancy within a thyroid nodule. Methods All patients with thyroid nodules who underwent ultrasonographic-guided fine needle aspiration and operative resection at our institution during 2007{\textendash}2008 were identified. Clinical records, biochemical profiles, pathology reports, ultrasonographic images, and cytology slides were reviewed. A multivariate logistic regression was used to quantify the value of the variables in estimating the risk of malignancy. Results The records of 158 patients with 190 nodules were reviewed. Eighteen nodules were excluded. The 8 variables with the greatest predictive value selected for the nomogram were biochemical (thyroid-stimulating hormone), ultrasonography (shape, echo texture, and vascularity), and cytology (nuclear grooves, pseudoinclusions, cellularity, and presence of colloid). The nomogram had an excellent predictive accuracy with a concordance index of 91{\%}. Conclusion We produced a nomogram that can quantify accurately the risk of malignancy in a thyroid nodule based on biochemical, ultrasonographic, and cytologic features.}}
