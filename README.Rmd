# Thyroid Cancer Prediction

The goal of Thyroid Cancer Prediction is to investigate and predict malignant thyroid nodules.

## GitHub Pages

This project includes a website which is written in [Quarto](https://quarto.org) and published via GitHub Pages.

This includes summaries of the data which can not be included in the repository. In order to update the website you need
to publish them locally using the [`quarto
publish`](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html#publish-command) command.

After making any modifications to `.qmd` files you therefore need to run.

```bash
quarto publish
```

Note you do _not_ have to include the `_site/` directory in the GitHub repository. Running the above commands includes
these in a separate branch (`gh-pages`) and pushes the changes to GitHub.
